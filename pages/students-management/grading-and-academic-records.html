        6. Grading and Academic Records
        Track Grades: Record grades for each subject at the end of each term, exam, or semester.
        This could include midterm results, final exams, and other assessments.
        Grade Reports: Generate and print detailed grade reports for individual students.
        Include subject-wise marks, grade points, and overall GPA.
        Transcript Generation: The system should allow for generating transcripts, showing the student's complete
        academic performance over the years.
        Ranking: Rank students based on their performance in the class, or provide percentile scores.
