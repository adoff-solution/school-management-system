        5. Attendance Management
        Mark Attendance: Admins or teachers should be able to mark student attendance daily (or per class session).
        Track whether the student is present, absent, or late.
        Absence Report: Generate reports on student attendance (e.g., number of days absent, percentage of attendance).
        Leave Requests: Allow students or parents to request leave for specific days, which can be approved or rejected
        by the admin/teacher.
