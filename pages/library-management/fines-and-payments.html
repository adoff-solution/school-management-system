        5. Fines & Payments
        Late Fees: Implement a system for late fees for books returned after the due date. The fine could be a fixed
        amount per day or vary by book type.
        Track Payments: Keep a record of all fines paid by users.
        Waive/Adjust Fees: For special cases, allow an admin to waive or adjust fines (e.g., due to emergencies or
        system errors).
