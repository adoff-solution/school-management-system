        5. Teacher Attendance Management
        Mark Teacher Attendance: Admins or department heads should be able to mark teacher attendance daily or per
        class, including any leave taken.
        Track whether the teacher is present, absent, on leave, or late.
        Leave Management: Allow teachers to apply for leave through the system. Administrators can approve/reject leave
        requests.
        Track sick leave, vacation days, and personal leave.
        Attendance Report: Generate reports showing teacher attendance patterns, such as total days worked, leaves
        taken, and any absenteeism.
