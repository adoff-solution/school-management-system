        15. Teacher Substitution and Scheduling
        Substitute Teachers: Track teachers who are absent and assign substitutes for their classes. This ensures that
        teaching continuity is maintained.
        Schedule Adjustments: Allow flexibility to adjust schedules when needed (e.g., special events, school holidays,
        teacher training, etc.).
