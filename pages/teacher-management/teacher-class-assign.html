        3. Teacher Class Assignments
        Assign Subjects: Assign teachers to specific subjects and classes/sections. For instance, a teacher may be
        assigned to teach "Mathematics" for Grade 9, or "Biology" for Grade 12.
        Class Schedule: Maintain the weekly teaching schedule of each teacher, showing the subjects, periods, and
        classrooms assigned.
        Class/Section Management: Track which teacher is responsible for each class and section, making it easier to
        organize and allocate resources.
