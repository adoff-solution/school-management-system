        4. Teacher Timetable Management
        Create/Update Timetable: Generate and manage timetables for teachers, showing the exact days, periods, and
        subjects they will be teaching.
        View Timetable: Allow teachers to access their personal timetable to check what classes they have on which days.
        Period Substitution: If a teacher is absent, substitute teachers can be assigned to their classes. You should
        track these substitutions to maintain consistency.
