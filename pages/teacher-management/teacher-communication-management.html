        Email/Message Notifications: Enable communication between teachers, students, and parents. For example, teachers
        can send out notices about upcoming assignments, exams, or changes in class schedules.
        Parent-Teacher Meetings: Schedule and track parent-teacher meetings, allowing teachers to provide feedback on
        studentsâ€™ progress and behavior.
        Student Mentoring: Allow teachers to mentor students, especially in cases where students are struggling
        academically or socially.
